Dynamic Market Price Analyzer

Dynamic Market Price Analyzer is a web-based system that empowers farmers with real-time, location-specific market prices, SMS alerts, and next-day price predictions. Many farmers struggle with delayed or inaccurate local price information, forcing them to rely on middlemen and make poor selling decisions. This system solves that problem by delivering instant price updates from markets within a 10 km radius and predicting next-day trends using historical data.

With features like geolocation filtering, SMS notifications, and a simple Linear Regression-based prediction model, farmers can make informed financial decisions, improve transparency, and reduce dependence on intermediaries.
